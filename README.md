This tool helps to build REPLs (read-eval-print-loops) for the command line.
It offers an API whose aim it is to make the command line more convenient to work with for project-based stuff.
It is taken from my `lapr` project, where it serves as interface for the latex project manager.

The idea is that you have some tool that offers an API for manipulation and you need a front-end for that.
This is exactly what this is for.
